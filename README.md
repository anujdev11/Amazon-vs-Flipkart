# Amazon-vs-Flipkart

Amazon or Flipkart? The age old question for us lazy people who cannot be bothered to compare prices. You’re probably wondering why this even concerns you. On the surface, it seems like there probably won’t be much of a difference but it goes much deeper. In fact, on delving into the data the difference becomes pretty significant in our daily lives of online shopping.

## The data gathering hustle
After creating two scrappers and bypassing all the hurdles to gather data on thousands of Mobiles on Amazon and Flipkart into a CSV.We took the common Mobiles out joined the two Tables.We calculated the price difference relative to the Flipkart price and we calculated the price percentage difference from the Flipkart price.

## Conclusion
Moving on (finally) to the actual point of all of this, deciding which site you should actually use. Well, here it seems Dr Doe has the advantage for Mobiles. That is Amazon. Overall the best idea is to check and compare both sites to get the best deal.
But if you’re too lazy to compare and buy Phones, you could stick to Amazon all the time and they’ll provide the better or equally good deal 70% of the time compared to Flipkart.
